Small Program to detect whether your CPU has the FDIV bug recently 
found in the Pentium. Executables included for OS/2 2.x and up, 
and for DOS, plus (the tiny) source code.

The OS/2 executable is updated to not use C-Set optimization,
which gaves misleading results on a 386/386. A Dos executable
(p87test.com) is included, which when run under real DOS ( not
a OS/2 VDM), shows the internal step level of the Pentium CPU.
